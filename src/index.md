**[PLACEHOLDER]** MTD for Self Assessment applies if your business or property income is £50,000 or more per year from April 2026, or £30,000 or more from April 2027. If you're VAT registered, you're already required to use MTD for VAT. Check your total income from self-employment and property rental to determine if you meet the threshold.

<summary><h3>Do I need special software?</h3></summary>

**[PLACEHOLDER]** Yes, you need MTD-compatible software to submit your tax information digitally. There are free software options available, and you can use spreadsheets with bridging software. The software must be able to submit information directly to HMRC's systems.

<details>
<summary><h3>What happens if I don't comply?</h3></summary>

**[PLACEHOLDER]** HMRC can issue penalties for late or incorrect MTD submissions. However, there is a "soft landing" period when MTD first starts, and HMRC considers reasonable excuses. Penalties use a points-based system that accumulates for repeated late submissions.

<details>
<summary><h3>Can I still use spreadsheets?</h3></summary>

**[PLACEHOLDER]** Yes, you can use spreadsheets for MTD if you use bridging software to connect them to HMRC's systems. Bridging software transfers data from your spreadsheet to HMRC. However, you still need to keep digital records and use digital links between software.
